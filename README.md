# Tetris2048
Tetris 2048 is a combination of the classic Tetris and the 2048 puzzle games. In the game, players try to achieve high scores by both arranging and sequentially completing Tetris-style blocks and combining numbers merging in the 2048 game.

# Usage Instructions
How to Play Tetris 2048:

- Left Arrow Key: Move the current tetromino left.

- Right Arrow Key: Move the current tetromino right.

- Down Arrow Key: Accelerate the falling speed of the current tetromino.

- Up Arrow Key: Rotate the current tetromino clockwise.

- Space Bar: Instantly drop the current tetromino to the bottom.

Scoring:

- Clearing Rows: When you fill an entire row with blocks, it clears from the board, and you earn points based on the number of rows cleared at once.

- Merging Tiles: If two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers. For example, if two tiles with the number 2 touch, they merge into a single tile with the number 4. Each merge also earns you points.

Winning and Losing:

- Winning: If you reach a tile with a value of 2048 or higher, you win the game.

- Losing: The game ends if you run out of space for new tetrominoes to enter the board.

Difficulty Levels:

Choose from Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulty levels to adjust the speed of the falling tetrominoes. You can select your preferred difficulty level from the menu before starting the game.
